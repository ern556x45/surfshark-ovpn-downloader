Hello.

I have made an automatic script to void the issue of the same files being used all the time.

The script itself has comments under each command explaining why and how it works.

This is using the Shark-china one click download link. It should autodelete all files and replace them with new ones.

Renaming the unzip file is prone to producing errors so I would suggest keeping it like this and relying on the rm command to avoid bloating up the system.
